    <p>The Last of Us is violent and maudlin. It depicts a world in which people are doing what they can to survive, with varying degrees of horror; at times,
        encountering the quick-moving, fungus-dangling infected doesnâ€™t even seem like the worst thing that could happen. Later in the series, in one terrifying episode, 
        men, not monsters, prove themselves capable of inflicting cruelties that go far beyond the distressing onslaught of zombie attacks.</p>
